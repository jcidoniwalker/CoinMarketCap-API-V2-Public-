**NOTICE: The Public API will be taken offline on December 4th, 2018. Please migrate your application to the free tier of the Professional API. Thus, this script will need modification to allow for an API key! I will (personally) not support this script further. **

This is a simple script that will fetch a JSON decoded array from a REST API (source: coinmarketcap.com)
This script is intended to act as a "canvas", allowing programmers utilizing this script to have full flexibility
in modifying this script to their own personal needs.
